# Changelog

## 0.5.5 — 2026-10-17

Android Auto shapes draw the raw stroke while the pen moves and snap on lift (or stay freehand), recognizing many more shapes including triangles, diamonds, polygons, stars, double arrows and rotated rectangles and ellipses; queued phone changes are combined per item and one sync drains the whole queue instead of a few per tap. Android versionCode 17. See [release notes](docs/releases/0.5.5.md).

## 0.5.4 — 2026-10-11

Android shapes gain an Auto mode (the new default) that turns rough rectangles, circles, triangles, arrows and lines into clean shapes, and the shape menu opens when the tool is chosen; desktop and Android readers get a draggable page scrollbar and a page number you can type to jump. Android versionCode 16. See [release notes](docs/releases/0.5.4.md).

## 0.5.3 — 2026-10-08

Android pinch zoom and scrolling no longer relayout every frame or wait on page renders; ink, highlights and notes are local-first and sync on open, leave, background, Sync now and every 15 minutes; the desktop Hub keeps a stable port so paired phones survive restarts; Settings shows the real version and the library uses the News Papers mark. Android versionCode 15. See [release notes](docs/releases/0.5.3.md).

## 0.5.2 — 2026-10-07

Figure grids whose bold caption label is set apart from the caption text stay in one crop, with the caption as one block; stored PDFs are re-extracted on open and keep their translations. Android versionCode 14. See [release notes](docs/releases/0.5.2.md).

## 0.5.1 — 2026-10-07

Books over 300 pages can be translated whole again, alongside page-range translation; widening to the whole book reuses sections already translated. Android versionCode 13. See [release notes](docs/releases/0.5.1.md).

## 0.5.0 — 2026-10-07

Android zoom and pan keep the page visible and no longer crash; changes sync in realtime through Hub events; pen input no longer lags and shapes work; a long-press drags a lasso selection as one group; figure and equation buttons appear only on tap; paragraph selection covers whole lines; translated figures use one scale; figure and region questions send the image itself on desktop and Android; PDFs up to 3000 pages and 300 MiB open, with section translation over 300 pages; the connect screen explains Tailscale. Android versionCode 12. See [release notes](docs/releases/0.5.0.md).

## 0.4.2 — 2026-10-06

Collapsed answer cards can be dragged by the whole marker on the desktop (a press on the marker was ignored, so only its 4px edge moved it) and can be dragged at all on Android; the source stays highlighted while dragging. Android versionCode 11. See [release notes](docs/releases/0.4.2.md).

## 0.4.1 — 2026-10-06

Answer cards are pinned to the page, stay until deleted, are restored with their position when a paper is reopened (synced between desktop and Android), collapse to a marker, and highlight their source passage, figure or equation while hovered or dragged. The desktop and Android apps include the Apache-2.0 license, the PaperRead MIT notice and generated third-party license lists, plus the Electron and Chromium notices on desktop, under Settings → Open-source licenses. Android versionCode 10. See [release notes](docs/releases/0.4.1.md).

## 0.4.0 — 2026-10-06

Translation: vector figures are kept whole with their labels, bold abstracts and two-line titles stay together, accents and inline math are preserved, exported PDFs fit each original page on one sheet, and the Android translated view shows figures, tables and equations. Questions are conversations with follow-up context, quotes attach to one question, the input is reduced to a model picker, the answer language moved to Settings, and the desktop side panel can be resized. Android versionCode 9. See [release notes](docs/releases/0.4.0.md).

## 0.3.1 — 2026-10-06

The "News Papers" wordmark stays on one line in the desktop sidebar. Android versionCode 8. See [release notes](docs/releases/0.3.1.md).

## 0.3.0 — 2026-10-06

Fractal is renamed News Papers (repository `iwantgobackhome/news-papers`). Desktop data is copied to the new location on first start. Android is a new app (`app.newspapers.reader`), with a transitional Fractal-named APK for 0.2.x updaters. New N·P icon generated from one source, a macOS grid app icon and a monochrome menu-bar template. Settings show the version and a Check for updates button. Android versionCode 7. See [release notes](docs/releases/0.3.0.md).

## 0.2.4 — 2026-10-06

Codex and Claude CLIs are detected on macOS and Linux when Fractal starts from Finder, the Dock or a desktop launcher. The in-app installer supports macOS and Linux, and its Windows Codex (npm) and Claude (from PowerShell 7) installs are fixed. Failed installs show the installer output. A CI workflow installs and detects both CLIs on Linux, macOS and Windows. Android versionCode 6. See [release notes](docs/releases/0.2.4.md).

## 0.2.3 — 2026-10-05

Android highlights and notes whose selection ended inside a word are shown again; rows saved by 0.2.2 are repaired on Android and sync to the desktop. Unsigned macOS builds now announce new releases and open the download page. Android versionCode 5. See [release notes](docs/releases/0.2.3.md).

## 0.2.2 — 2026-10-04

Android: character-level long-press selection that follows visual lines (including inline math), tap elsewhere to clear, answer markers in the page margin that reopen minimized answers, a working fine pen-width slider with a size readout, tool-name tooltips on stylus hover or long press, and desktop-added papers that open in the reader after sync. Desktop: the answer popup model list stays open during translation. Android versionCode 4. See [release notes](docs/releases/0.2.2.md).

## 0.2.1 — 2026-10-02

In-app updates for Windows NSIS, Linux AppImage/deb and the Android APK (macOS stays DMG-only). Reliable pairing and batched sync for large ink histories. Movable, collapsible answer popups for questions and explanations on desktop and Android. On Android: no text-selection mode (long press then drag selects, the pen inks), precise column-aware selection, a circular live eraser and Explain chips on detected figures, tables and equations. On both platforms: live region rectangles and tap-to-delete highlights. Android versionCode 3. See [release notes](docs/releases/0.2.1.md).

## 0.2.0 — 2026-10-01

Scholarly desktop and native Android interfaces; persistent research history and annotations; sticky notes; Saved/Recent and nested folders; native News/Topics and split article reading; exact text selection; in-app publication PDF acquisition and cached reading. Discovery tries genuine captioned paper figures or news content images before suitable source thumbnails, caches verified images, and retains text when no usable image is available. Cross-platform packaging now targets Windows x64 NSIS, Linux x64 AppImage/deb, separate macOS arm64/x64 DMGs and a stable debug-signed Android APK (versionCode 2).

Published [0.2.0 downloads](https://github.com/iwantgobackhome/fractal/releases/tag/v0.2.0) include all six distributions and checksums. The [tagged native CI run](https://github.com/iwantgobackhome/fractal/actions/runs/36845792076) passed all five platform jobs, bundled desktop Hub/PTY startup and APK identity/signature checks; downloaded payloads and source/resource evidence were independently reviewed before publication. See [release notes](docs/releases/0.2.0.md) for signing qualifications and verification limits, and [release builds](docs/RELEASING.md) for the build process.

## 0.1.0

Existing public release with Windows and Android downloads. Preserved as published; 0.2.0 does not replace its tag or assets.
